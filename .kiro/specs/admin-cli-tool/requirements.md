# Requirements Document

## Introduction

관리자가 CLI를 통해 라운드를 쉽게 생성, 관리, 모니터링할 수 있는 통합 CLI 도구를 개발합니다. 현재 분산된 스크립트들을 하나의 직관적인 CLI 인터페이스로 통합하여 관리자 경험을 개선하고 운영 효율성을 높입니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a unified CLI command to manage all round operations, so that I can efficiently operate the betting platform without remembering multiple script commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the CLI tool without arguments THEN the system SHALL display a help menu with all available commands
2. WHEN I use the CLI tool THEN the system SHALL provide consistent command syntax across all operations
3. WHEN I execute any command THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and status updates
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new rounds with simple commands, so that I can quickly set up betting rounds without complex environment variable setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the create command THEN the system SHALL prompt for required parameters if not provided
2. WHEN I create a round THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters before execution
3. WHEN I create a round THEN the system SHALL display the round address and transaction hash upon success
4. WHEN I create a round THEN the system SHALL save the round information for future reference
5. WHEN I specify token symbols THEN the system SHALL validate they are supported before creating the round

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view the status of current and past rounds, so that I can monitor the platform's activity and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the status command THEN the system SHALL display current active round information
2. WHEN I run the status command THEN the system SHALL show time remaining, prize pool, and participant count
3. WHEN I request round history THEN the system SHALL display a list of past rounds with their outcomes
4. WHEN I view round details THEN the system SHALL show betting statistics for each participating token
5. WHEN no active round exists THEN the system SHALL indicate this clearly and suggest next actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to finalize rounds when they end, so that I can ensure proper settlement and winner determination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the finalize command THEN the system SHALL check if the round has actually ended
2. WHEN I finalize a round THEN the system SHALL fetch current token prices automatically
3. WHEN I finalize a round THEN the system SHALL display the winning token and prize distribution
4. WHEN I finalize a round THEN the system SHALL update the round history records
5. WHEN a round cannot be finalized THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure and manage supported tokens, so that I can add new tokens or modify existing ones for betting rounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the token management command THEN the system SHALL display currently supported tokens
2. WHEN I add a new token THEN the system SHALL validate the token address and symbol
3. WHEN I add a new token THEN the system SHALL verify price feed availability
4. WHEN I remove a token THEN the system SHALL check if it's used in active rounds
5. WHEN I update token information THEN the system SHALL preserve existing round data integrity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the CLI to handle network configuration automatically, so that I can focus on round management without worrying about blockchain connection details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the CLI THEN the system SHALL detect the appropriate network configuration
2. WHEN I switch networks THEN the system SHALL update contract addresses accordingly
3. WHEN network connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN I deploy to different networks THEN the system SHALL maintain separate configuration profiles
5. WHEN I use the CLI THEN the system SHALL validate my account has sufficient permissions and balance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to export round data and statistics, so that I can analyze platform performance and generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request data export THEN the system SHALL generate CSV or JSON format files
2. WHEN I export round data THEN the system SHALL include all relevant metrics and timestamps
3. WHEN I export betting statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate win rates and profit margins
4. WHEN I specify date ranges THEN the system SHALL filter data accordingly
5. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL indicate the file location and format
